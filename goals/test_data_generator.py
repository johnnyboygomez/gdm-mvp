"""
Simulates real-world syncing delays: 
- Each user/dataset has a random (but contiguous) number of days with step data.
- The possible number of days is [days_ago-2, days_ago-1, days_ago], always contiguous from the earliest day.
- Goals: week 1 if at least 7 days; week 2 only for 14 days.
- UPDATED: Creates data in Fitbit format: [{"date": "2025-09-03", "value": 2941}, {"date": "2025-09-04", "value": 3008}]
- NEW: Adds realistic fluctuation with occasional "off days" and "great days"
- UPDATED: Now includes previous_target field in expected goals
